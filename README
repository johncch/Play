I. Purpose
 The main purpose of Play is to display text overlayed on video. This
 software was written to complement a chamber music event, in which words
 to the program music were to be flashed onto the screen at certain parts of 
 the music. In addition, there was to be a video underneath all the words.

 This software is released open source under the MIT license, and I hope it would
 be useful for anyone who has similar requirements.

II.A Requirements
 Play requires Adobe AIR 2.0 runtime to install

II.B Build Requirements
 Play requires Flex 4 SDK and AIR 2 SDK to build. The source shipped with AirEvents
 taken from http://labs.flexperiments.nl/a-real-native-alert-for-flex-air/ with no
 license, and requires Greensock tweening platform 11 from http://www.greensock.com

 A sample build file is provided that can be run using Ant. To test in non windows
 environment, change ADL in build.properties from adl.exe to adl. As a result of Ant
 and the Flex compiler, Java is required.

III. Support
 Play is provided as is with no support. However, you may file bug reports or write
 to johncch@gmail.com
